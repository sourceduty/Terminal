Process Model Builder is a comprehensive terminal-based Python application designed for creating highly customizable process models. It allows users to build and save models with various architecture levels such as Super, High, Medium, and Low. The program supports advanced features like step types (e.g., Standard, Decision, Parallel, End), priorities, and descriptions. Users can customize their process flow with different arrow types (→, ←, ↔, ⇄), reorder steps, delete them, or edit their details. By offering a step-by-step guided menu, the program is intuitive to use and ensures users can visualize their process models effectively. Once the process model is complete, it can be saved to a text file, making it a practical tool for project managers, engineers, or analysts designing workflows or systems.

For example, if a user builds a process model at the "Medium Level," they may add steps such as "Data Collection" (Standard type) → "Decision Analysis" (Decision type) → "Report Generation" (End type). The process model will be displayed as:

Data Collection [Standard] → Decision Analysis [Decision] → Report Generation [End]

The user can save this model into a text file named medium_level_model.txt for future reference. If customization is required, the user can select arrows like "↔" to signify bidirectional steps or add a description like "Critical step" with a high priority. For instance:

Data Collection [Standard] - Collect initial datasets (Priority: High) ↔ Decision Analysis [Decision] - Evaluate outcomes ↔ Report Generation [End]
